      Naoto is an orphan who acts very mature in spite of her age. 
      As a descendant of a respected lineage of famous detectives, she wears formal clothing and deepens her voice when 
      she speaks in a sophisticated, stilted manner. She is generally very serious, focused and mission-oriented. 
      She rarely jokes around which can make her seem like a killjoy or party pooper when the team is involved in silly antics. `,

       She is referred to as a "dangerous girl" by Chie Satonaka, due to her boldness in flirting with the protagonist, and her teasing of 
       Yosuke Hanamura and Kanji Tatsumi. Rise is quickly annoyed by the smallest things, which ends up with her crying dramatically, and sometimes 
       producing crocodile tears. She's rather childish and possessive; she once pouted and told the protagonist he mustn't call another girl "cute."`,
